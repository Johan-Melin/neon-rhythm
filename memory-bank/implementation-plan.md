Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
Instructions:
Create the following folders: src, assets, css, and public.
Inside src, create subfolders: scenes, objects, utils, and game.
In the public folder, create an index.html file with a basic HTML structure.
Test:
Run npm install and check the node_modules folder for the three directory.
Confirm the folder structure: src/scenes, src/objects, src/utils, src/game, assets, css, and public/index.html.

Step 2: Create the Main Game File
Instructions:
Set up a basic Three.js scene, perspective camera, and WebGL renderer.
Create a render loop using requestAnimationFrame to continuously render the scene.
Link the renderer to the index.html file by appending it to the DOM.
Test:
Open index.html in a browser.
Verify a black canvas appears on the page with no console errors.

Step 3: Implement Basic Player Movement
Instructions:
In src/objects, create a file named player.js.
Define a Player class that creates a simple 3D object (e.g., a cube) to represent the player’s vehicle.
In game.js, instantiate the Player class and add the player object to the scene.
Add event listeners for arrow keys to move the player left and right.
Test:
Load the game in the browser.
Press the left and right arrow keys to ensure the player moves horizontally across the screen smoothly.

Step 4: Add a Basic Track
Instructions:
In src/scenes, create a file named track.js.
Define a Track class that generates a simple, straight track (e.g., a flat plane).
In game.js, instantiate the Track class and add the track to the scene.
Position the player object so it starts on the track surface.
Test:
Open the game in the browser.
Confirm the track is visible and the player rests on it, able to move left and right along its surface.

Step 5: Implement Automatic Forward Movement
Instructions:
In player.js, add a method to update the player’s position forward automatically.
In game.js, call this method within the render loop to simulate constant forward motion.
Test:
Start the game and observe the player moving forward along the track without any key presses.
Ensure the movement speed is consistent and smooth.

Step 6: Add Basic Obstacles
**�t - In src/objects, create a file named obstacle.js.
Define an Obstacle class that creates simple 3D objects (e.g., boxes or spheres).
In track.js, add a method to spawn obstacles at random horizontal positions along the track.
Add spawned obstacles to the scene in game.js.
Test:
Run the game and watch as the player moves forward.
Verify obstacles appear on the track at varying positions and remain visible as the player approaches.

Step 7: Implement Collision Detection
Instructions:
In game.js, create a function to check for collisions between the player and obstacles.
Use Three.js’s Box3 or similar bounding box method for collision detection.
Log a message to the console when a collision occurs.
Test:
Move the player into an obstacle using arrow keys.
Check the browser console for a collision message.

Step 8: Add Collectibles
Instructions:
In src/objects, create a file named collectible.js.
Define a Collectible class that creates small 3D objects (e.g., glowing spheres).
In track.js, add a method to spawn collectibles at random horizontal positions along the track.
Add spawned collectibles to the scene in game.js.
Test:
Start the game and move the player forward.
Confirm collectibles appear on the track at random positions as the player progresses.

Step 9: Implement Collectible Interaction
Instructions:
In game.js, extend the collision detection function to detect player-collectible intersections.
When a collectible is collected, remove it from the scene and log a message to the console.
Test:
Move the player into a collectible.
Ensure the collectible disappears from the track and a message appears in the console.

Step 10: Add Basic Scoring System
Instructions:
In game.js, create a score variable initialized to zero.
Increment the score when a collectible is collected.
Add a simple HTML element (e.g., a <div>) in index.html to display the score, styled via css.
Update the score display in the render loop.
Test:
Collect several collectibles while playing.
Verify the score increases and updates correctly on the screen.

Step 11: Implement Health System
Instructions:
In game.js, create a health variable initialized to 3.
Decrease health by 1 when the player collides with an obstacle.
Add a health display element in index.html, styled via css.
Update the health display in the render loop.
Test:
Collide with obstacles multiple times.
Confirm health decreases and the display updates accurately.

Step 12: Add Game Over Condition
Instructions:
In game.js, check if health reaches zero in the render loop.
If health is zero, stop the render loop and display a "Game Over" message via an HTML overlay.
Test:
Collide with obstacles until health reaches zero.
Ensure the game stops and a "Game Over" message appears on the screen.

Step 13: Integrate Basic Audio
Instructions:
In src/utils, create a file named audio.js.
Use the Web Audio API to load a background music file from the assets folder.
In game.js, start the music when the game begins.
Test:
Launch the game and listen for background music.
Check the console for no audio-related errors.

Step 14: Synchronize Obstacles and Collectibles with Music
Instructions:
In track.js, adjust obstacle and collectible spawning to occur at fixed intervals (e.g., every second).
Tie the interval timing to the game’s runtime, approximating music rhythm for now.
Test:
Play the game and observe obstacles and collectibles appearing at regular intervals.
Confirm the timing feels rhythmic and consistent with the background music.

Step 15: Add Visual Effects for Interactions
Instructions:
In game.js, add a simple visual effect (e.g., a color flash or particle burst) when collecting a collectible.
Add a different effect (e.g., a red flash) when hitting an obstacle.
Use Three.js features like materials or basic particle systems.
Test:
Collect a collectible and verify a visual effect occurs.
Hit an obstacle and confirm a distinct effect appears.
